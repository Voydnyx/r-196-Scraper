# r-196-Scraper

This code will scrape the top 10 hot posts from the r/196 subreddit and, if the post has a URL that ends in .jpg, it will post the picture to Twitter along with the post's title.

You may need to install the praw and tweepy libraries by running pip install praw and pip install tweepy in your terminal.
